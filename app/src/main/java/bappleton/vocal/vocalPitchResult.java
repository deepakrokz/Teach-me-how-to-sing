/**
 * Created by Brian on 10/27/2016.
 * Important information about this class:
 *
 *      Regarding purpose:
 *          This class accepts a TarsosDSP PitchDetectionResult object
 *          It uses the PitchDetetionResult information to calculate other information pertinent to Vocal
 *          Primarily, this includes:
 *              The piano key number closest in frequency to the detected pitch
 *              The name of the piano key .... ^
 *              Error between the exact pitch and the closest piano key, expressed as a percent 0-100
 *          This class is the basis for an object that includes "everything we need to know" about the detected pitch.
 *          It can be passed via Message between threads using the .obj parameter.
 *
 *      Regarding frequency:
 *          We are using the twelve-tone equal tempered scale
 *          A4 is the 49th key on the piano and is assigned a frequency of 440 Hz
 *          Frequency of other notes is found based on their location relative to A4, the 49th key
 *              Given a key in location n, its frequency is: 2^((n-49)/12) * 440 Hz
 *              The lowest key we'll recognize is C0, the -8th key (it's not on a piano)
 *              The highest key we'll recognize is B8 (also not on a piano)
 *
