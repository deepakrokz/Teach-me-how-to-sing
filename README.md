We are a team of 4 graduate students trying to make an Android app called **VOCAL** which will teach users how to sing.
We plan to achive the goal by doing real time pitch detection based on *[YIN Pitch Detection Algorithm](http://audition.ens.fr/adc/pdf/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf)* and provide the feedback to the user via a pointer and a background of musical note scale as shown below...
