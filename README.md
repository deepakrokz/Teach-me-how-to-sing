#Demo FFT program with GraphView display
This demo program generates a 100Hz sinewave that is approximately 0.5 seconds long, and then collects 512 samples at a sampling frequency of 1000Hz. It then computes a DFT and plots the results using the open-source GraphView library. The plot below shows the square of the magnitude of the signal in the frequency domain vs. frequency.
