#Python FFT Development

##sin_plotting.py
This python program uses numpy and matplotlib to generate a simple sinusoid, compute its FFT, and plot the results. It's a good sandbox for experimentation and learning.

##mixed_sin_fft.py
Same idea, but computes the FFT for two sinewaves with different frequencies that have been superimposed
