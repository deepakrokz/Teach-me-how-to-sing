**EC601 Project: Teach Me How To Sing**

We are a team of 4 graduate students trying to make an Android app called **VOCAL** which will teach users how to sing.
We plan to achive the goal by doing real time pitch detection based on *YIN Pitch Detection Algorithm* and provide the feedback to the user via a pointer and a background of musical note scale as shown below...
